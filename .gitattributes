# Configure Git to handle line endings across operating systems.
#
# '* text eol=lf' tells Git to:
#   1. Treat files as text.
#   2. Always use LF line endings in the repository.
#   3. Always use LF line endings when checking out files (i.e., even on Windows).
#
# This helps:
#   - Ensure consistent line endings in the repository.
#   - Prevent unnecessary line endings in diffs.

# Default: treat all files as text with LF line endings.
* text eol=lf

# Possible binary file patterns are explicitly marked to prevent corruption.
