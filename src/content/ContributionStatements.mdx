## Contribution Statements

Together with each group assignment submission,
group members will individually submit a contribution statement.

A contribution statement should be brief and include four components:

1. **Time and Contributions**

   First indicate approximately how much time you spent on this group assignment
   (i.e., in hours, including time spent working individually or with others).

   Then summarize your individual contributions to the group assignment
   (i.e., what major activities did you complete in the overall assignment).
   Optionally, you may choose to indicate how much time you spent on each major activity
   or may choose to provide more context around how those activities contributed to the group assignment.

   We ask for this in part to promote reflection and discussion within a group
   (i.e., some tensions in groups can be attributed to "invisibility" of conducting high-quality work).
   If issues begin to develop within a group, consider reviewing and discussing the time and contributions of each member.

2. **Percentage Contribution Estimates**

   List the name of each member of your group (i.e., including yourself).
   Indicate an estimated percentage of effort each member contributed across all activities in the group assignment.
   This should sum to 100%.

   Each contribution statement must include percentage contribution estimates.

3. **Group Check-In**

   We understand, and expect that you will understand,
   that different group members will have different constraints throughout the course.
   We do not necessarily expect all group members to contribute equally to each assignment,
   but do generally expect contributions will "even out" across the larger course.

   If you indicated any group members contributed notably more or less than others,
   briefly describe your perspective on that.
   This might be praise for a perceived strong contribution,
   or it might be your perspective on a dynamics around perceived low contribution.

   Additionally, if there are any challenges with group dynamics
   such that you would like staff to be aware or to consider engaging, you can also share that here.

   If there is nothing notable to share,
   you can omit this or simply indicate you feel things are going as expected.

4. **Individual Check-In**

   If you would like the staff to be aware
   of any factors that impacted your individual contribution,
   we encourage you to share them here.
   Additional context,
   such as your expectation of confidentiality and whether your group members are aware of any situation,
   can also be useful for helping the course staff support all group members.

   If there is nothing notable to share,
   you can omit this or simply indicate you feel things are going as expected.

An example contribution statement therefore might be:

  > __Your Name__
  >
  > __Time and Contributions__
  >
  > I spent a total of approximately 12 hours on this assignment.
  >
  > Most of that was in implementing front end functionality,
  > including several hours on a particularly frustrating bug.
  > I then also spent about an hour preparing my portion of the report.
  >
  > __Percentage Contribution Estimates__
  > - Your Name: 25%
  > - Name: 15%
  > - Name: 35%
  > - Name: 25%
  >
  > __Group Check-In__
  >
  > Overall this assignment went smoothly,
  > Name really took the lead on coordinating our work and did a great job with it!
  > Other Name was less involved,
  > but they communicated this clearly and it was not a problem.
  >
  > __Individual Check-In__
  >
  > I was sick over the weekend,
  > but communicated that and then worked to catch up.

If there is anything in your contribution statement that suggests a challenge in contribution
(e.g., in your percentage contribution estimates,
in your group check-in comments,
in your individual check-in comments),
or if there is anything that leads you to anticipate continued challenges,
we encourage you to reach out via email to the course staff.
Contribution statements are intended to pro-actively gather everybody's perspective,
which then also support your own reflection and discussion.
An email to the course staff will help ensure prompt engagement with this information.

The staff also understands that percentages are incomplete and subjective,
so we gather them only as a summary indication and do not use them directly in any grade calculation.
