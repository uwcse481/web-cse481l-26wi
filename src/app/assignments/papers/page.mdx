# Paper Presentations

<UnderDevelopment display={false} />

Pairs of students will lead in-class presentation and discussion of research papers exploring human-AI interaction.

Our goals for this presentation and discussion format are to:
- Introduce students to principles of and explorations in human-AI interaction.
- Provide a structure in which students can learn about and discuss those explorations.
- Help to surface approaches and insights that may benefit students in their own work.

## Student Presentations
Students will sign up in pairs to collaborate to present assigned papers and to facilitate in-class discussion.

The pair of presenters is responsible for the paper presentation.
They are expected to collaborate in reading and understanding the paper,
then in developing and delivering a presentation.
If a student is unexpectedly unable to deliver an in-person presentation,
the other is expected to be familiar with and prepared to deliver the presentation.

Other students are not expected to have read the paper being presented.
Presenters therefore play a key role in structuring our opportunity to learn about these papers.
Presenters are also expected to take questions from students working to understand approaches and insights from the papers.

### Presentation Format
Each paper will be allocated approximately 10 minutes for its presentation,
then additional time for questions and discussion around one or more papers.

Presentations should be organized as:

- 1 minute to briefly acknowledge the authors and any notable background.

  You will not have time to share the background of all authors,
  but should briefly research each author and concisely share your most important findings
  (e.g., background other students might want to know if they met an author).

- Primary research activities of the paper (e.g., a system, a study, an analysis).

  Discuss the human-centered needs and tasks the research aims to address.

  Discuss how AI is integrated or explored in the research.

- Key additional details of the research (e.g., system details, study design, theoretical insights).

  Additional details needed for a high-level understanding of the presented research activities.

- At least 3 key findings, ideas, or takeaways from the paper.

  Present what seems most important about this paper.

  Remember that your primary audience is other students in this course.

  Present what people might take from this paper in their own work.

- A prompt for questions or discussion with the class.

### Presentation Timing

Be sure to rehearse the presentation to stay within timing.

Other students will be recruited to provide presenters with in-class feedback on timing.

## Presentation Logistics

### Sign Up

Presenters and will sign up using a shared document:

<CourseDataLink linkHref={courseData.offering.linkDrivePresentationSignup} outerComponent="p"/>

The total number of presentations students are asked to give in the quarter
will be determined according to the number of students in the class and the total number of papers.

### Shared Slides

Presentations will be facilitated using a template provided in the course Drive.
Each presentation has its own Slides template, in a folder within the course Drive:

<CourseDataLink linkHref={courseData.offering.linkDrive} outerComponent="p"/>

### Canvas Submission of Draft Slides

As documentation of preparation for presentations,
presentation groups are required to submit a near-complete PDF of the presentation by 8pm two days before class
(i.e., Sunday 8pm for a Tuesday class, Tuesday 8pm for a Thursday class).
The submitted draft is expected to be appropriate and have all necessary content,
but presenters may continue to iterate to further improve the presentation prior to class.

Canvas support is limited, so we have created assignments with no specific due date.
Any individual's first paper presentation should be submitted as "Paper Presentation 1".
That same individual's second paper presentation should then be submitted as "Paper Presentation 2".
Both members of a presentation group should submit the PDF
(i.e., because this is easiest for course staff in monitoring Canvas assignments).
If a Canvas submission is accidentally delayed,
contact the staff by email to ensure we are aware the slides were appropriately prepared by the time of the deadline.

### Canvas Submission of Contribution Statements

After each presentation is complete,
presenters should provide brief confidential feedback on contributions.
