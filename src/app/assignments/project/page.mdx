# Project

<UnderDevelopment display={false} />

Design and prototype an interactive system that explores human-AI interaction.
You will work in a group to design and develop a prototype that incorporates a language model
and demonstrates thoughtful design according to principles of human-AI interaction.

The goals of this project are to:

- Explore principles of human-AI interaction through your design and implementation.
- Apply human-centered design methods to inform and refine your design.
- Implement a vertical prototype that demonstrates key design concepts.
- Present insights gained through your work.

This project builds upon the skills developed in the technology lab,
extending them to a larger-scale group effort with a focus on design and development.

      Summarize key activities and learnings in your initial exploration of language model support.
    - If understanding those requires additional supporting documentation,
      provide that in the same folder in a human-readable format (e.g., another document, PDFs).
      Appropriately reference this supporting documentation in your description.
      We do not intend this to be a burden,
      so you may decide whether you feel such documentation is necessary for engaging with course staff around your design.

  - This reflection should focus on a goal for formative research relative to the principle.
    This will require identifying a principle that is relevant to one or more elements of your design proposal,
    then reflecting on the need to more thoroughly explore these elements of your design relative to the principle.
    Consider what decisions you might aim to make, what you might aim to learn,
    or how your design might evolve in response to formative research.

  (e.g., a principle articulated in one of the papers discussed in "Principles of Human-AI Interaction").
  - This must not exceed 150 words.
  - Begin by stating and crediting the principle, then reflect on your formative research relative to that principle.
  - This reflection should focus on a specific finding and how it motivated changes or validated your design.
    This will require identifying a principle that is relevant to one or more elements of your design,
    then considering your findings and changes relative to the principle.
    Consider how the finding shaped new understanding of the principle,
    how your changes align with or were informed by the principle,
    or how the principle highlights a challenge or design tension around the finding.

### Poster

<UnderDevelopment display={true} />

Create a poster that communicates your design and related findings, insights, or learnings.
Present your work in a visual form that quickly conveys its most important aspects. Your poster should include:
- Project Title
- Your Names
- Motivation and Approach
  - The need, opportunity, or problem explored in your design.
  - The overall concept of your design and your focus within that concept.
- Key Human-AI Interaction Functionality
  - This likely corresponds to your 3 task scenarios.
- Key Findings, Insights, or Learnings
  - Include 3 key findings, insights, or learnings.
  - At least 1 should relate to your interface design.
  - At least 1 should relate to the underlying use of a language model.

For consistency in printing and display, your poster must be 32" x 40" (i.e., portrait, vertical).

The staff have assembled several templates you can use as a starting point:
- <a href={Paths.basePath + pathPosterTemplateA}>Powerpoint Template A</a>
- <a href={Paths.basePath + pathPosterTemplateB}>Powerpoint Template B</a>
- <a href={Paths.basePath + pathPosterTemplateC}>Powerpoint Template C</a>

You should heavily modify the template to be unique and represent your project:

- Posters are intended to support a conversation about your project.
- Your poster should emphasize images and include limited amounts of text.
- Be sure images are clear and legible (e.g., with appropriate contrast).
- Modify the template colors to ensure your poster is unique.

As you plan content for your poster,
be mindful that you will also have a demo and a video available during the final poster showcase.

Submit via Canvas.
Due to frequent challenges in printing, submit both:
- A PDF of your poster.
- The source file for your poster (e.g., a PPTX file).

We then expect teams to be available and responsive via email for feedback and rapid iteration to finalize the poster.

**Due:** {formatCalendarDate(calendarData.assignments.projectPoster.date, "EEE MMM d")}, 8pm

    then reflect on your interactive prototype and usability testing relative to that principle.
  - This reflection should focus on a specific insight and how it motivates changes or validates your design.
    This will require identifying a principle that is relevant to one or more elements of your design,
    then considering your insights and changes relative to the principle.
    Consider how the insight shaped new understanding of the principle,
    how your changes align with or were informed by the principle,
    or how the principle highlights a challenge or design tension around the insight.

Submit a Design Status Report as a separate document.

- If helpful or needed, you may submit multiple videos in this assignment.
  Be sure each video is clearly named to indicate what we will see in that video.
  For example, you might submit a short and polished video conveying the interaction in each task scenario,
  appropriate for later re-use and without any narration.
  You might then also submit a longer unedited version of the same video, including narration intended for course staff.

Ensure the full code of your interactive prototype is committed to your GitLab project.
- Include a brief README.md that details how to build and run your prototype.

## Design Status Reports

<UnderDevelopment display={true} />

Several deliverables include a design status report.
The format of each design status report is consistent,
so that you can maintain and evolve such reports throughout the project.

Submit each design status report in a separate document that does not exceed 700 words.
- Author this in the same Drive folder as the relevant deliverable.
- Begin by copying the provided template document.
- Include images where helpful to illustrate your design.
- Images do not count against the word limit.

Include the following sections:
- Summarize your current design.
  Include a brief description of its overall concept
  and where you are focusing your exploration of human-AI interaction within that overall concept.
  - This must not exceed 100 words.
  - Each design status report will include this summary.
    You may simply copy it forward between deliverables,
    but should ensure it remains current as your design and your approach evolve in the project.
- Illustrate 3 primary task scenarios.
  Recall a scenario demonstrates how a task is accomplished with a design.
  You will continue updating these task scenarios as you develop your design.
  - Each scenario must not exceed 200 words.
  - Each design status report will include your task scenarios.
    You may copy them forward between assignments,
    but should ensure they remain current as your design and your approach evolve in the project.
  - In one sentence, describe the task (i.e., what is accomplished).
  - Use images to illustrate the scenario via a walkthrough of each key step in accomplishing the task with your design.
    These can be sketches, mockups, or other illustrations of how a person will experience the scenario.
    As you develop more of your project, these should become screenshots showing interaction with your design.
  - Convey the walkthrough in enough detail that course staff can understand step-by-step interaction with your design.
    We expect each scenario will include multiple images, but do not expect more than 6 images in a scenario.
  - Any text used in the walkthrough does not count against the word limit.
  - After the walkthrough, highlight key specific changes or details of your design
    that are most important for understanding your design.
    Share a brief rationale for those specific aspects of your design.
  - Describe your current understanding of language model support needed in the proposed interaction.
    Consider when and how your design will invoke the language model throughout the scenario.
    Consider the expected input and output for these language model invocations.
  - If understanding your approach to language model support requires additional supporting documentation,
    provide that in the same folder in a human-readable format (e.g., another document, PDFs).
